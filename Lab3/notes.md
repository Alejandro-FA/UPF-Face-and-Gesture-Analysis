# Notes

We have to compare the non-infinity values of the consistency matrix with the similarity matrix. For the error we can simply use the mean absolute error. We then compare this with random anotations using bootstrap.

1. Analyze your consistency matrix to verify the reliability of your annotations

2. Compare your results with a random annotator (similarity and consistency matrices)

3. Compute the dissimilarity matrix

4. Extract the first two bases using mds

    - Analyze the 24x24 dissimilarity matrix, image dependent, emotion dependent...

5. Visualize the 2D representation of the dta

6. Compare your bases with the traditional valence and arousal
