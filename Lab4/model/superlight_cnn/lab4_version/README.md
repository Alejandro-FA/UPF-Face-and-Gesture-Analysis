# Architecture of our feature extractor for Lab 4

Lighter version of the LightCNN model. This folder contains checkpoints for the model for each of the 30 epochs that were used to train the model.

The model starts overfitting the training data from epoch 6 onwards. Therefore, we recommend to **use checkpoint 5**.
